# genChars
A python-based CLI tool for generating random strings

**Tested and Created on:**
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (x64)

**Steps to get this CLI tool working:**
1. Make sure you have python 3.x and pip installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. In your terminal type `chmod +x install.sh`. This will make the bash script executable.
4. In your terminal type `./install.sh.` This will run pip and the dependencies will be automatically installed.
5. If all goes well, you can type into your terminal `genChars [-length x]` and it'll blurt out the random string of length x (12 if nothing is given).
